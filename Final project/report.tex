\section{Bag-of-words model}

\subsection{Description and classification algorithms}

We first implemented the bag-of-words model. From the train and test datasets, two matrices of size n\_documents x n\_terms were computed, using the dictionary of terms present in the train dataset. Then, each document can be seen as a vector in dimension n\_terms.
\\We tried out several classification algorithm on it:
\begin{itemize}
	\item k-Nearest Neighbors: for a given document of the test dataset, we find out the k closest documents in the train dataset using cosine similarity. Then, we assign to the test document the most frequent label among these k neighbors. Arbitrarily, in case of equality, the first label in alphabetic order among the most frequent will be picked up.
	\item Support Vector Machine: we used a Gaussian kernel, and cross-validation was made in order to select best values for parameters C and gamma.
	\item Random Forest: we made a cross-validation to select the optimal number of trees to compute.
	\item Adaboost: we also made a cross-validation for the number of boundaries here.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Results}

As suggested in the subject, we used micro-averaging and macro-averaging precision and recall in order to evaluate the performances of our classifiers. We can notice that micro-averaging precision and recall are indeed the same number.
\\Cross-validations were made upstream in order to find the optimal values for the parameters: k for k-NN, C and $\gamma$ for RBF-SVM, number of trees for random forests. With these parameters fitted, here are the different performances the algorithms achieved :
